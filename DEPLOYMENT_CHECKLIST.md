  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/services/telegram.py`
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/api/orders.py`
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/app.py`
- [ ] Review all new files:
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/utils/logging_utils.py`
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/utils/circuit_breaker.py`
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/utils/analytics.py`
  - [ ] `felix_hub/backend/api/metrics.py`

### Testing
- [ ] Run syntax checks: `python3 -m py_compile <files>`
- [ ] Run basic tests: `python3 test_monitoring_features.py`
- [ ] Verify all imports work

### Documentation
- [ ] Review `MONITORING_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Review `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Bookmark documentation for team

## Staging Deployment

### Deploy
- [ ] Merge to staging branch
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### Smoke Tests
- [ ] Health check responds: `curl https://staging.app.com/health`
- [ ] Dashboard loads: `curl https://staging.app.com/api/metrics/dashboard`
- [ ] Create test order via API
- [ ] Check logs for correlation IDs
- [ ] Verify structured logging format

### Verification
- [ ] Check notification success rate endpoint
- [ ] Verify alerts endpoint works
- [ ] Check circuit breaker status
- [ ] Review logs for structured format
- [ ] Test metrics endpoints with various parameters

## Platform Configuration

### Health Checks
- [ ] Configure platform health check path: `/health`
- [ ] Set healthy status code: `200`
- [ ] Set unhealthy status code: `503`
- [ ] Set check interval (recommended: 60s)
- [ ] Set timeout (recommended: 10s)

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (if available)
- [ ] Create alert for `DEAD_LETTER` in logs
- [ ] Create alert for `Circuit breaker.*OPEN`
- [ ] Create alert for `status:critical`

### Alerts
- [ ] Configure alert on health check failure (503)
- [ ] Configure alert on notification failure spike
- [ ] Set up notification channel (email/Slack)
- [ ] Test alert notifications

## Production Deployment

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Staging verification complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Platform configuration complete
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

### Deploy
- [ ] Merge to main/production branch
- [ ] Tag release (e.g., v1.x.x-monitoring)
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs

### Immediate Post-Deploy (First Hour)

#### 0-15 minutes
- [ ] Health check returns 200: `curl https://app.com/health`
- [ ] Dashboard accessible: `curl https://app.com/api/metrics/dashboard`
- [ ] No critical alerts: `curl https://app.com/api/metrics/alerts`
- [ ] Application responding normally

#### 15-30 minutes
- [ ] Review logs for structured format
- [ ] Check for any error spikes
- [ ] Verify correlation IDs present
- [ ] Monitor notification success rate

#### 30-60 minutes
- [ ] Check `/api/metrics/notifications/success-rate`
- [ ] Should be >95% (target >99%)
- [ ] Review any failures: `/api/metrics/notifications/failures`
- [ ] Check circuit breaker status: `/api/metrics/circuit-breakers`
- [ ] Review dashboard for anomalies

### Extended Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

#### Every 4 hours
- [ ] Check dashboard: `/api/metrics/dashboard`
- [ ] Review notification success rate
- [ ] Check for alerts: `/api/metrics/alerts`
- [ ] Review logs for `DEAD_LETTER` entries
- [ ] Monitor circuit breaker status

#### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Notification success rate (target >99%)
- [ ] Orders per day (trending normally)
- [ ] Status change counts (as expected)
- [ ] Circuit breaker state (should be CLOSED)
- [ ] Alert count (should be 0)

### Daily (First Week)

#### Morning Check
- [ ] Review `/api/metrics/dashboard`
- [ ] Check notification success rate (last 24h)
- [ ] Review `/api/metrics/alerts`
- [ ] Search logs for `DEAD_LETTER`
- [ ] Review any circuit breaker openings

#### Issues to Watch For
- [ ] Success rate dropping below 99%
- [ ] Circuit breaker frequently opening
- [ ] Multiple `DEAD_LETTER` entries
- [ ] Stuck orders alert
- [ ] Health check failing

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

#### Immediate Actions
1. Check `/health` status
2. Review `/api/metrics/alerts`
3. Check logs for errors
4. Assess impact

#### Decision Criteria for Rollback
- [ ] Health check consistently failing (503)
- [ ] Notification success rate <90%
- [ ] Circuit breaker stuck OPEN for >10 minutes
- [ ] Database connectivity issues
- [ ] Application errors affecting users

#### Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Notify team
2. [ ] Revert to previous version
3. [ ] Deploy reverted version
4. [ ] Verify health check returns 200
5. [ ] Confirm application functioning
6. [ ] Review rollback logs
7. [ ] Document issue for post-mortem

## Success Criteria

### After 24 Hours
- [ ] ✅ Notification success rate >99%
- [ ] ✅ No critical alerts
- [ ] ✅ Circuit breaker remains CLOSED
- [ ] ✅ <5 `DEAD_LETTER` entries (ideally 0)
- [ ] ✅ Health check consistently returns 200
- [ ] ✅ All metrics endpoints responsive
- [ ] ✅ Structured logs visible and searchable

### After 1 Week
- [ ] ✅ Average success rate >99.5%
- [ ] ✅ No recurring alert patterns
- [ ] ✅ Circuit breaker stable
- [ ] ✅ Team comfortable with monitoring tools
- [ ] ✅ Dashboard integrated into daily workflow

## Post-Deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Update team wiki with monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Share `MONITORING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` with team
- [ ] Add monitoring to onboarding docs
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Demo dashboard to team
- [ ] Explain structured logging
- [ ] Show how to use correlation IDs
- [ ] Explain alert conditions
- [ ] Demo searching logs

### Optimization
- [ ] Review alert thresholds (adjust if needed)
- [ ] Identify any unnecessary logging
- [ ] Optimize slow metrics queries (if any)
- [ ] Consider additional metrics to track

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider metrics dashboard UI
- [ ] Explore real-time alerting (webhooks)
- [ ] Consider metrics export to Prometheus
- [ ] Plan Grafana integration
- [ ] Evaluate OpenTelemetry for tracing
